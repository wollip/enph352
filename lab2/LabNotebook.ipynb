    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing low temperature and small signal measurement is crucial to many fields of physics. In this lab we will work with a thermal diode and measuring its resitance through a 4 wire measuring scheme. The 4 wire measuring scheme is important for measuring same resistance and it allows you to ignore the resistance of th leads. In additional, a lock-in amplifier will be used as a way to filter out a signal of a particular frequency and see how the voltage changes at the frequency from due to superconductivity. It works by multiplying two signal together essentially being an analog fourier transform for specific frequency. In this experiement these methodology will be applied to measuring the changes in resistance of the thermal diode and of the magnetic field of YBCO.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Measure the resistance of the thermal diode as it change in temperature to calibrate it. As the temperature change, measure the magnetic field of the YBCO as it affects the magnetic field of the coil around it. Observe the Messner Effect and measure the London penetration depth for when a material becomes superconductive at it $T_C$ temperature"

    "## Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "Dewer with Liquid Nitrogen to cool the apparatus. \n",
    "Outside of the dewer there is a magnetic coil to induce an external magnetic field\n",
    "Inside of the dewer there are two coils with opposite winding.\n",
    "One of the two coils will have YBCO in the center of the coil\n",
    "The external magnetic field will induce a magnetic field on the inside coils \n",
    "Each coil will have the opposite magnitude voltage due to the winding\n",
    "The difference in the voltage will be fed as signal into the lock-in\n",
    "The reference signal for the external magnetic field will be the reference of the lock-in\n",
    "There is a 4 wire measurement of the temperature diode inside the dewer\n",
    "There is a heating coil that will accelerate the proprocess of warming up the dewer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messner Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "When a material becomes a superconductor, the magnetic field inside of it gets expelled from its interior. At the surface of the superconductor the magnetic field decrease exponentially similar to skin depth with electric field and conductors. Similarly there is the London Pentration depth that quantifies the depth. In this lab we will the below values to calibrate and observe how $\\lambda_L$ changes with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda_L(77K) = 300nm$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|V_{coil} - V_{coil}'| = C (1-\\frac{2\\lambda_t}{t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4 Wire Measurement \n",
    "\n",
    "A 4 wire measurement is a device that measures resistance. Here two wire supply a current through the device while two more measure the voltage. This way the resistance in the voltage wires are negated as there is no significant amount of current passing through them that results in a poor measure of voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = \\frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thermal Diode\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal diode is a device that changes resistance with temperature. However, the change in resistance is quite small therefore a 4 wire measurement is used. It is also non-ohmic therefore a constant current bias is used. The measured voltage will have the form below\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{n}{V_g 2e} - \\frac{n k_B}{2} (\\frac{5}{2} \\ln (T) - \\frac{\\ln(I_f)}{K})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ (1<n<~2.5) is known as 'nonideality factor'. $K$ depends on the details of the diode and $V_g$ is the band gap of the semiconductor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Thermal Diode can be calibrated using room temperature and measurements at 77.4K\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lock-in measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a input signal and an output signal is mixed together. A low pass filter is then used so that only the DC voltage remains. This process is similar to a fourier transform at a single frequency. In addition because a low pass filter is used, there is a time constant associated with it, therefore it is important to make sure measurements happen when it is at steady state."

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied from the lab report with modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study I — Lock-in Signal Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the experiment will introduce you to lock-in detection of small signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the highest and lowest available time constants on the lock-in? What is the best frequency resolution you would expect from each? (This unit has a second filter stage, labelled as “Post,” for steeper roll-off. You should disable it, by setting it to “None.”)\n",
    "2. As a test, we’ll use the lock-in amplifier to measure the resistance of a very small resistor. You should find a small slab of aluminum at your bench, with four female banana connectors. Use the digital multimeter’s four-wire resistance function (method mentioned earlier) to find its resistance, and thus its resistivity. The voltage-sensing leads are labelled as “$\\Omega 4W$ Sense” and the current source is marked with a lightning bolt. Remember, you want to measure the voltage due to a current, and you’re trying to eliminate any effects from resistance in the leads or contacts. Perform a two-wire measurement for comparison.\n",
    "3. Now, connect the function generator to a $∼50\\Omega$ resistor (use the resistance box) in series with the aluminum bar. This acts as a current source. You can measure the current through the bar by measuring the (AC) voltage across the known resistance with the multimeter. Now connect the lock-in amplifier to the aluminum bar. Using the lock-in voltage measurement and the previous current measurement, determine the resistance, and resistivity, of the bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Study II — Magnetization of YBa2Cu3O6.95\n",
    "You will now determine the magnetic properties of a crystal of YBCO by AC susceptometry. Refer to Figure 10.3 for a diagram of the apparatus.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open LabView program.\n",
    "2. Take a measurement of the diode voltage under bias current, using the four-wire resistance measurement function of the multimeter, with the range manually set to $10k\\Omega$. The multimeter must remain on this resistance range for the duration of the experiment. As long as the bias current stays fixed, it is ok for you to record the diode voltage in units of ohms (these are the units that the multimeter will supply the voltage in - because it thinks its making a resistance measurement). A resistance value for 77K should already be present in the LabVIEW program, completing the temperature calibration - you don’t need to adjust this point.\n",
    "3. Connect the function generator ($10kHz, 10V_{pp}$) to the lock-in’s Reference input and the outer coil, and the detector coil (susceptometer output) to the lock-in’s A input. Raise the drive coil to envelope the susceptometer, watching the signal on the lock-in. It should reach a maximum, then decrease toward the centre of the drive coil. Why? Find the position that minimizes the magnitude of the signal (i.e. get it close to zero), and use this position for the remainder of the experiment.\n",
    "4. The test tube containing the probe needs to have 1 atm He gas in it. To this end, pump out whatever gases may be in it using the vacuum pump, then gently fill it with helium gas and close the valve. Fill the dewar with liquid nitrogen. The diode’s resistance should rise rapidly, then level off as the probe approaches 77K.\n",
    "5. With the probe at liquid nitrogen temperature, remove the helium. Start the pump, and, leaving the He-line valve closed, pump down to $\\lesssim 200$ torr. Set the phase on the lock-in to zero, and ensure that the signal is not off the scale. Leave the pump pumping on the dewar for the duration of the experiment, and then leave it pumping when you leave the room. With the helium removed, you may slowly warm the sample, using the DC power supply as necessary. Take data as you do so. You want the probe to warm at about 0.5 K/min. Continue recording the lock-in output and resistance to at least 105K.\n",
    "6. You might expect your plot of lock-in voltage vs. temperature to be zero above T_c, where the field fully penetrates the superconductor, but your graph will probably show an offset and a slope in this regime. What causes can you think of for the slope and offset? To remove this background signal, fit the linear portion above T_c, and subtract this line from the entire data set.\n",
    "7. Rescale your data so the voltage values vary from zero to one. Since $V \\propto  |\\vec m(T)|$, this plot shows $|\\vec m(T)| |\\vec m(To)| \\text{vs.} T$.\n",
    "8. Finally, use Equation 10.16 or 10.17 to extract $\\lambda_L(T)$. To do this, take $\\lambda_L(77K) = 3000 \\mathring A$, and the sample’s dimensions as $5.50 \\times 4.35 \\times 1.30 mm^3$ , $\\pm 0.05$ in each. Generate a log-log plot of $\\lambda_L(T)$ over the range $T_c - 10K \\rightarrow T_c$. The x-axis should use $\\frac{T_c - T}{ T_c}$ instead of T. Is there any evidence of a power law $\\lambda_L(T) \\propto \\frac{T_c−T}{T_c}^n$ ? (Note that the assumption $\\lambda_L$ is not true very close to $T_c$, because $\\lambda_L$ diverges at $T_c$.)\n",
    "9. Leave pump on (Tongkai will turn off). Lower coil, and put a piece of paper over the top to catch dripping condensation from the susceptometer.\n"
