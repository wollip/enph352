    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is a different type of wave compared to light. It can also have frequencies low enough for the eye to see in comparison to light. Hence we want to learn about how wave of matter behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the dispersive properties of the wave. (phase velocity and group velocity)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apparatus\n",
    "\n",
    "A rectangular container filled with water. One side of the the container has a paddle to create an initial impluse. Two QRD sensors are used to measure the height of the water at their locations.\n",

    "    * Height of water on oneside change\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is a typical wave height over time spectrum for the two sensors. It can be seen that the initial time is cut off. As we are only interested in the modes once the wave start. The bottom is the fourier transform of the spectrums with the label peaks for modes 1 - 10\n",

The fitted model assumed gravity is 11.01m/s^2. This is most likely due to the walls of the experiement adding addition forces.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Time\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be time error, but it should be safe to assume the computer time is accurate. Then the only other issue with time is the time resolution. As frequency is the inverse of time, time resolution would give us a frequency resolution. However \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta f = f^2 \\Delta t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the range of frequencies we are looking at (1hz to 5hz), the frequency resolution is at least 0.01hz. Which is more than good enough\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wave height\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be issues with wave height from the sensors we used. However, wave height doesn't affect the fourier transform. Which is the only data we are interested in. Noise is typically high frequency and as we only need the low frequency data, the noise is irrelevant. Furthermore, we only care about the mode of the frequency, which can be clearly seen in the fourier transforms. The only inaccuracy would be finding the peak location, which should not be affected by noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modes peak\n",
    "\n",
    "The peaks of the fourier transform are in general pretty sharp, therefore, using FWHM for the peak uncertainty, we should expect no more than $ \\pm 0.1 Hz$. This difference is not enough to explain the difference between the theorhetical and seen results. Therefore, in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiemental setup\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a big difference between the measured values and the theorhetical values. This could be due to surface tension of the water as well as friction between the water and the sides of the tank. It might be ideal to use a wider tank to see if better results can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actuation of the paddle might also not be an ideal source to start the wave. Alternatives could be looked into."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In general the data followed the trend as expected from theorhetical values. However, due to fundamental problems in the experiemental setup, accuracy measurements of the frequency modes were not possible. The different in theorhetical values could be accounted for by increasing gravity from 9.81m/s^2 to 11.01m/s^2. Further exploration into this phenomenon is necessary."
