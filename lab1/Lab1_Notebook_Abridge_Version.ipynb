    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring the energy of particles is crucial to many physics experiements. This is usually done by looking at the interaction of the particles with a medium that is well understood. A common apparatus used is a scintillator, which can convert gamma radiation to lower-energy photons, which can be easily detected by phototubes. Phototubes can then covert the low energy photons into electrical signals that are easier to process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scintillator : a material that fluoresces when struck by a charged particle or high-energy photon. (Google definitions)\n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To use known sources of gamma ray energies (from $^{137}\\text{Cs, }^{109}\\text{Cd, }^{60}\\text{Co}$) to calibrate our detection system and to determine the energies of unknown sources ($^{54}\\text{Mn, }^{22}\\text{Na, }^{133}\\text{Ba}$). The calibration will be done through identifying the photopeak of each spectrum, and understanding of the underlying physics (photoelectric effect, compton scattering, electron-positron pair production)"

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma rays from the source will hit the scintillator to be coverted to low energy photons. The photons will be collected by the phototube and converted to electric current. The overall effciency for converting gamma ray energy to electric current is on the order of 0.15%. Each gamma ray will therefore produce an electrical pulse of amplitude proportional the to the energy absorbed by the detectors. Below are some processes of gamma ray conversion that results in different energy absorbed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here photopeak will refer to amplitude created when all of the energy is absorbed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Photoelectric effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Photon is completely absorbed. This process will create a spike at the photopeak.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compton effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Photon bounces off and only transfer part of the energy. The photon could eventually leave the scintillator with some energy, so this process will sometimes be less than the photospeak\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electron-Positron Pair Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Some energy goes into excitation of electrons, the rest is converted to two gamma rays each with 0.511MeV. Depending on whether the gamma rays is absorbed, the signal could be at the photopeak, 0.511 MeV or 1.022Mev less than the photopeak.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backscatter\n",

    "Photon pass through the detector, but bounce of the enclosure and back into the detector. "

    "* With regards to the Compton scattering process. The corresponding spectrum is continuous, and is characterized by a high-energy edge. Why?\n",
    "    * Perhaps something to do with the photoelectric work function?\n",
    "* With regards to backscattering. What sort of spectrum would you expect from such events?\n",

    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Copied from the Lab Manual\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The power supply voltage should be at 1300 V. Adjust the amplifier gain such that the 60Co source gives a maximum signal that is not off-scale (if the spectrum goes off the right side of the screen you need to turn down the gain). Check your signals with an oscilloscope and familiarize yourself with the Personal Computer Analyzer software.\n",
    "2. Record spectra from the 137Cs, 109Cd, and 60Co sources. Using the known energies for the gamma rays emitted from these sources (chart on the west wall of the laboratory or a reference), generate a calibration curve for the gamma ray energy in terms of the channel number.\n",
    "3. With this calibration, determine the energies of peaks observed in the 54Mn, 22Na and 133Ba spectra, and compare with their expected values. \n",
    "4. For all of the spectra, **identify as many of the features** as possible. You will need to determine and use the relationship between the energies of the **Compton edge, photopeak and backscatter peak**. Report the **width of each photopeak**.\n",
    "5. For the 137Cs source, determine the efficiency of this detection system. You will need to record the date and initial activity of the source."

    "    * Backscattering is just be compton scattering in the enclosure. Except the photons, would need to bounce back at almost 180 degrees into get back into the detector. Therefore, backscattering peak + compton edge should be around the photopeak. Since the backscattering peak is the energy that is not absorbed after the maximum possible is absorbed by the enclosure.\n",

    "## Final answers to questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why and where does Compton's Edge occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheuse is that there is a maximum amount of energy a photon can transfer during the Compton Scattering process. From energy conservation, we see that the energy transferred depends on the geometry of the collision between the photon and the electron. When the photon leaves the collision in the direction it came from that is when the most energy is transferred. Through this experiement we can see that this theorhetical prediction matches with what we observed in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Why and where does the backscattering occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheuse is that compton scattering occurs in the enclosure of the detector, the photon then leaves the enclosure and gets back into the detector. Based on the geometry of the detector and the enclosure, the photon would have to leave the enclosure in the opposite direction in order to go back into the detector. This means the photon would leave approximately the energy of Compton's Edge before returning to the detector. From the experiments, we see that the backscattering peak is actually just a little bit above the initial energy subtracting the Compton's Edge energy. This is most likely due to the fact that the photon does not have to go completely in the opposite direction but rather just get close enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Why and where does the electron positron pair production occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypotheuse is that only one of the gamma rays produced from the annihiltion of the electron positron pair would be detected. During this annihilation two gamma rays of equal energy would be produced. Based on momentum conservation, the two gamma rays must travel in the opposite direction. Based on energy conservation, the energy of the two gamma rays combined should be equivalent to the energy of the electron positron pair. These two electron and positron have minimal amount of energy, so their combined energy is roughly just the rest energy of the two particles. Therefore the detector will only ever detect one of the two gamma rays at roughly 0.511MeV. From the experiments, this is exactly what we observed, there is a peak at 0.511MeV but none at 1.022MeV. Furthermore, as gamma ray produced is just like any other gamma ray, it is possible for it to undergo Compton Scattering and even form a backscattering peak, which we observe in the experiment. "

    "Through this lab, we have understood the process in which gamma rays interact with the scintillating detector. We empirically figured out the amount of radiation detected by the detector. We can calibrate the scintillating detector using known sources of radiation. Most importantly through the understanding of these processes, we can predict the shape of the spectrums for each radiation source."
